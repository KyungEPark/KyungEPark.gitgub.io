This is a personal page for Kyung eun (Trixie) Park.


About myself
------
Hi! I am glad that you decided to visit my personal page.
My name is Kyung eun Park. Trixie is my nickname that eases a lot of people to call and remember my name. You are free to decide which name you want to call me as. 

I come from South Korea, but have been living in Germany since fall of 2019. I am the second of four children, with fraternal twins below me, and a older sister who owns beautiful Maltese dogs.

You can always ask me anything you are curious about the two countries, and I will do my best to answer your questions.


In my free times, I enjoy a variety of hobbies that I sometimes cannot manage, including playing flute, singing and dancing, baking, drawing, and playing games.
My MBTI (Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator; *disclaimer: which I should not rely too much on, being an organization researcher - but this is big in Korea*) is **ENTP**.
